## Personal Website

As the intro on the website itself says, "This website is a place for me to practice my newly-learned web-development skills, showcase a digital version of my CV, and create an archive of projects both individual and collaborative."

Right now, I'm practicing HTML and CSS. 

Right now, the website showcases my CV and little else. But!

## The Plan

The plan for the website is, more or less, as follows (without wireframes or Kanban Board):

- replace the "more -->" links with JS that unfolds and refolds the sections
- do the same with the links the the "Further" section
- populate the "Projects" section with (at least) the following:
  - the Memo writing project
  - selections from my work with un-sound eV:
    - the Indeterminate Cage Lecture
    - Lyrik-a-go-go
    - images (and a soundclip?) from "Tuning Operation/Are You in the Mood?" with Thomas Wenk
- add a blog that only accepts and publishes markdown files
  - and migrate my current blog into it
